Every year, Digital Ocean and Github run [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/),
an event that celebrates open source and encourages people to contribute. The way it works is
simple: Submit four pull requests to projects on GitHub in the month of October, and get a free
t-shirt.

If you’re looking for a way to participate and want to do it in Rust, don’t worry, we’ve got you
covered! This event is coincidentally timed with Rust’s
[impl period](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/09/18/impl-future-for-rust.html),
where core Rust projects focus on implementing
things in their code over planning new things. This means we have a lot of bugs open right now, and
a lot of momentum for fixing them!

Check out [the findwork site](https://www.rustaceans.org/findwork) or
[this github search](https://github.com/search?l=Rust&q=label%3Ahacktoberfest+state%3Aopen+type%3Aissue&type=Issues)
for mentored bugs you can work on.
