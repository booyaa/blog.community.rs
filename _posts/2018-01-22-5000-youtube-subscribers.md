The [official Rust video channel](https://youtube.com/c/rustvideos) has crossed 5000 subscribers! Time for my personal review about running it. How big is it _really_, what are the most successful talks and which topics are of interest?

When I set up RustVideos in September 2016, it was more of a experiment, but it quickly gained traction. The thinking was quite straight-forward: instead of every meetup or project setting up their own video channel, we just started the one Rust channel you can subscribe to.

## What's there

RustVideos tries to collect all available videos on Rust. We either do so by either publishing the videos ourselves (a good example are the RustFest videos) or by republishing videos in our own [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYhcUwRBNscFNUKTjgPFiA/playlists). There's playlists by year and playlists for specific subjects.

What's currently notably missing are large tutorial series. I didn't feel comfortable assessing the quality of these up to know, but it is my goal this year to get some on the channel.


## The Rustbars

I'd like to give a little review of the three best running videos on the channel. Notably, this only includes videos _originally published there_, linked videos from other conferences, such as [Aaron Turons Keynote at ScalaDays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6dNx9pY7p8) will not be in the list.

### RustFest Kyiv: Ashley Williams - How I Convinced the World's Largest Package Manager to Use Rust, and So Can You!

A contender for the price of "Longest title of a talk given at a community conference during the year 2017 in Kyiv, Ukraine". The smashing success of this talk can only be explained by how close at heart this topic is to people: "I love Rust, I wish I could program it at work" is a regular sentiment. It is also a very actionable and positive talk, while at the same time explaining a hard problem people a huge part of the community struggles with.

Best comments:

> Excellent talk; even if you have no interest in Rust.

>  Great speaker; so funny I had to take a break so I could breathe!

### RustFest Kyiv: Lisa Passing - Making a game in Rust

The success of this talk can be explained by two pieces of feedback I got within 5 minutes at the conference: "This is too basic for a conference" and "This was great! Finally a talk I feel like I could start right away!". Conferences run a wide gamut of experiences and not every talk is there to tease the experts brain. What Lisa hits spot-on here (and intentionally so) is a providing a very accessible first talk destructing the notion that Rust is _incredibly hard_ to start with. The talk doesn't even try to pretend there's something incredibly new or advanced here. The result is simple, but understandable in 30 minutes. You could code that in a short pause afterwards!

> It's awesome to see Rust be the reason people web developers get into systems programming. It's almost strange that Rust has such a good community and friendliness about it. 

### RustConf 2017: Aaron, Carol and Niko

What a drop ;). To be fair, though, many videos cap out at ~7000 videos, this seems to be the viewer base that watches whole conferences.

I explain that by the fact that the Rust Keynote has a much more _core_ audience. It's of not so much use for you if you are not into Rust. That being said, it is a very good  summer keynote: it is very relevant, sets the stage for the rest of the conference _and_ the year. Having a group on stage also shows that Rust is not about single person leadership.

> This keynote really set the right tone for the future of Rust that the core team has envisioned.

## Personal favourites

Here's two talks I love very much - not only because they ran at my conference, but because they are so rare to get. The first is "The Rust that could have been" by Marijn Haverbeke.

It's a great tour of things that were cut from the language. What I love about the talk is that it is a collection of _failed ideas_ without being bitter about it.

The other one is "The Illustrated Adventure Survival Guide for New Rustaceans" by Lee Baillie.

I nearly [died laughing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_from_laughter) during this talk, especially as it has a very good way of subtly weaving in the issues that beginners have with seasoned Rust programmers :).

### Comment policy

The Channel has a _closed comment policy_ and as much as I hate that, it has been the best choice. The amount of comments that are clear violations of standards of general decency is non-trivial and I would not like to be the publisher responsible to exposing speakers to that.

That being said, we err on the side of publishing a comment in doubt and don't judge on its value - if it's not insulting or a clear unfounded personal attack, we publish. Rants, complaints and disagreement are all welcome and wanted.

That being said, comments are also often positive, which is why we don't want to switch them off.
